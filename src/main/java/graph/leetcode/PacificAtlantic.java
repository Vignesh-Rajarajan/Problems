/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/
 *
 * tricky flood fill variant
 *
 * The matrix is the continent with water on it and the boundaries are the oceans. Left and top being Pacific and right and bottom being the Atlantic.
 * The water on the continent (in the matrix) wants to flow out in the ocean. (Nature huh.)
 * The numbers in the matrix is the height of the water for that point.
 * For every point you have to ask the question. Can the water at this point and this height flow out in both the oceans
 * under the constraints of flowing through only four(up, down, right, left) directions and flow into channels with same height or less height?
 * If yes you return the coordinate of that point. Else you ignore it.

     * Now, if we start from the cells connected to altantic ocean and
     * visit all cells having height greater than current cell (water can only flow from a cell to another one with height equal or lower),
     * we are able to reach some subset of cells (let's call them A).
     *
     * Next, we start from the cells connected to pacific ocean and repeat the same process, we find another subset (let's call this one B).
     *
     * The final answer we get will be the intersection of sets A and B (A âˆ© B).
