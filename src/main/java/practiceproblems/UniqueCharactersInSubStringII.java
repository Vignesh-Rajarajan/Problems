    /**
     * Consider string "bcde"
     * <p>
     * ðŸŽ¯ lets talk about character 'c' that in how many substrings this 'c' will be counted as unique string
     * ::: left no of characters on L.H.S of 'c' = left
     * ::: left no of characters on R.H.S of 'c' = right
     * Then total possible substrings containing this 'c' = (left+1) x (right+1)
     * <p>
     * Thus contributions for c = 2 * 3 = 6
     * and those 6 substrings are ( bc, bcd, bcde, c, cd, cde )
     * <p>
     * So we can say that every character will have contribution of (left+1)x(right+1) to the ans.
     * <p>
     * ðŸŽ¯ But there is one small catch here !
     * What if characters are same ?? then only one of those characters will have contribution in any substring containing them.
     * "acca"
     * Here first 'c' will for sure have a contribution = (left+1)x(right+1) = 2 x 3 = 6
     * but for second 'c' Left region will be reduced till the rightmost 'c' on leftside. So the value of left for second 'c' will be = 0 !!
     * Right will have no change.
     * So contribution for second 'c' = 1 x 2 = 2;
     * <p>
     * This way we can calculate the contribution for each and every character in just one for loop.
