/**
 * Given a set of positive numbers, partition the set into two subsets with minimum difference between their subset sums.
 * Input: {1, 2, 3, 9}
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: We can partition the given set into two subsets where minimum absolute difference
 * between the sum of numbers is '3'. Following are the two subsets: {1, 2, 3} & {9}.
 *
 * Input: {1, 3, 100, 4}
 * Output: 92
 * Explanation: We can partition the given set into two subsets where minimum absolute difference
 * between the sum of numbers is '92'. Here are the two subsets: {1, 3, 4} & {100}.
